Hi there!

My name is Joshua DeNoble and I am currently a Junior in college studying Computer Science (no way!)
I like to imagine that I've been into computers since conception, but as that is physically improbable, I
usually just say that my interest started when I was 5. It was then that my older brother slapped a gameboy
in my hands and told me to have fun (I actually still have that same gameboy today)

I was homeschooled from 5th grade through high school, which enabled me to pursue the things I was interested
in at my own pace. I excelled in math and science and even skipped a grade in high school. Eventually I 
learned about "programming" and "computer science" through a friend (who I currently attend college with)
and immediately started learning whatever language I thought would be the most helpful - Java.

And that brings us to today. I'm currently attending Rowan University in New Jersey and am absolutely loving 
it. School gets a lot easier when you love what you're learning. The only problem I've found is that no matter 
how much you love what you do, it's still extremely difficult to get job experience when you don't already
have job experience.

Thanks Obam... Trump.
